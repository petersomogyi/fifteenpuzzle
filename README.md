=Fifteen Puzzle

The aim of the program is to find an optimal solution for the fifteen puzzle board game.

The program uses IDA* algorithm to find an optimal solution from a starting state which is submitted on the standard input.
The tiles are numbered from 0 to 15, where 0 represents the empty space. The tiles are in consecutive order.

The project is made for a university course at Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE).
